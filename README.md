# PyBer-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to understand the distribution of fare, ride, and driver data over different city types. We also explored how the total fares across these city types changed, on a weekly basis, over the course of several months. The purpose of summarizing the data as such was to understand how different variables affect the total fares in order to inform decision making at PyBer.
